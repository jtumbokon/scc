Perform comprehensive project analysis and learning:

1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
   - Run: tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|dist|build|.git'
   - Document organization

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK
   - Check: package.json, requirements.txt, Gemfile, pom.xml, go.mod
   - Identify: Language, framework, runtime, build tools, database
   - Note versions

3. ARCHITECTURE PATTERN
   - Analyze code organization
   - Identify: MVC, Clean Architecture, Microservices, Monolithic, etc.
   - Document structure

4. ENTRY POINTS
   - Frontend: Find index.html, index.tsx, main.ts, App.tsx
   - Backend: Find index.js, server.js, app.py, main.go
   - API: Locate routes/, api/, controllers/

5. CODING CONVENTIONS
   - Sample 10 files for naming patterns (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
   - Identify test framework and location
   - Document comment/documentation style

6. HIERARCHICAL SYSTEM
   - Check for .claude/ directory
   - Scan: rules/, templates/, agents/, skills/, hooks/, commands/
   - Document existing system or note absence

7. DEPENDENCY GRAPH
   - Create/update .claude/registry/dependency-graph.json
   - Include project metadata: stack, architecture, conventions

8. UPDATE CLAUDE.MD
   - Create or update .claude/CLAUDE.md
   - Include: Stack, Architecture, Conventions, Structure, Workflows
   - Add development commands (install, run, test, build)

Provide detailed summary with:
- Technology stack breakdown
- Architecture pattern identified
- Detected conventions
- Entry points list
- Hierarchical system status
- Recommendations for improvements

Be thorough and comprehensive. This is for deep project understanding.
