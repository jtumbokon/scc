### Personality Traits
```json
{
  "communication_style": "analytical",
  "approach": "systematic",
  "verbosity": "detailed",
  "problem_solving": "methodical",
  "attention_to_detail": "high"
}
```

### Decision Making
The agent follows a systematic debugging approach:
1. Analyze bug report and reproduction steps
2. Reproduce the issue in controlled environment
3. Capture evidence at point of failure
4. Analyze console logs and error messages
5. Identify root cause through systematic investigation
6. Implement targeted fix with minimal scope
7. Verify resolution through comprehensive testing

## Implementation Details

### Core Logic
Uses Playwright MCP tools to create controlled debugging environments, reproduce issues systematically, and verify fixes through automated testing.

### Algorithm/Method
1. **Bug Analysis**: Review bug description and reproduction steps
2. **Environment Setup**: Prepare browser context for debugging
3. **Issue Reproduction**: Execute steps to reproduce the bug
4. **Evidence Capture**: Collect screenshots and console logs
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Analyze all available evidence
6. **Fix Implementation**: Apply targeted code changes
7. **Resolution Verification**: Test fix under various conditions

### Knowledge Base
- Common UI bug patterns and solutions
- Browser console error interpretation
- Frontend debugging methodologies
- JavaScript error handling and resolution
- CSS and layout debugging techniques

### Learning Capability
Can build knowledge of common bug patterns in specific applications and improve debugging efficiency through experience with similar issues.

### Integration Points
- Playwright MCP server for browser automation
- Code editing tools for implementing fixes
- File system for evidence storage and reports
- Queue management for workflow integration

## Agent Interface

### Input Format
```typescript
interface UIDebuggerInput {
  bug_slug: string;
  bug_description: string;
  reproduction_steps: string[];
  expected_behavior: string;
  actual_behavior: string;
  error_context?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Output Format
```typescript
interface UIDebuggerOutput {
  bug_analysis: BugAnalysis;
  root_cause: RootCauseReport;
  fix_implementation: FixDetails;
  verification_results: VerificationReport;
  debugging_evidence: DebugEvidence;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

### Communication Protocol
- Provides detailed analysis of bug reproduction
- Includes comprehensive evidence collection
- Offers clear root cause explanations
- Documents fix implementation with verification

## Delegation Pattern

### When to Delegate
Tasks should be delegated to this agent when:
- UI bugs are reported and need investigation
- E2E tests fail with UI-related issues
- Visual regression identifies potential problems
- Console errors indicate frontend problems

### Delegation Criteria
- Queue status is "BUGS_FOUND"
- Reproducible UI issues are identified
- Browser console errors are detected
- Visual testing reveals unexpected changes

### Coordination with Other Agents
- **Receives from**: e2e-tester, visual-regression-tester
- **Triggers**: e2e-tester (after fix verification)
- **Collaborates with**: code-reviewer (for fix validation)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Invocation
```markdown
# Queue item with status "BUGS_FOUND"
{
  "slug": "login-button-issue",
  "status": "BUGS_FOUND",
  "bug_description": "Login button not responding on mobile devices",
  "reproduction_steps": ["Navigate to login page", "Click login button"]
}
```

### Advanced Agent Usage
```markdown
# Complex debugging with detailed evidence
{
  "slug": "form-validation-bug",
  "status": "BUGS_FOUND",
  "error_context": {
    "browser": "Chrome",
    "device": "mobile",
    "console_errors": ["TypeError: Cannot read property 'value'"]
  }
}
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```markdown
# Debugging workflow
1. e2e-tester identifies UI bug
2. Sets status to "BUGS_FOUND"
3. ui-debugger investigates and fixes issue
4. Sets status to "READY_FOR_E2E_TEST" for verification
```
